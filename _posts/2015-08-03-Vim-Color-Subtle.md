title: Vim-Subtle Colorscheme for VIM
excerpt: I had made a color scheme for VIM text editor called vim-subtle.
---
[Vim-Subtle](https://github.com/idling-mind/vim-color-subtle) is a colorscheme for Vim text editor. Its a bit easy on your eyes and I prefer this one to any other colorschemes available for Vim.

It works well in gui as well as in terminal.
You will have to enable 256 colors in vim and also set the terminal to be xterm-256 colors.

```vimscript
    set t_Co=256 
```

Here is a screenshot of the colour in terminal window

And here is a screenshot of the same in gvim.
