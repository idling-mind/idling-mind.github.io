Got my blog online. It was a struggle! I am pretty new to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (i'm pretty new to [Github](https://github.com) as well!). I heard about [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for the first time today. It took some time to figure out what it is.

Now that I figured out what Jekyll is, next I wanted to use it to run my blog; and for that every site that I found a tutorial on Jekyll suggested to install a Jekyll on my local machine. I run a windows machine and well, thats not an operating system for the hackers! so well, that didnt go well. After an hour or two, I decided to just download an already working Jekyll site and modify that and thats where I found [this template](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) from. 

I just downloaded the entire git, tried to understand how things are working by going through the files as well as reading a bit about Jekyll and Markdown, made some changes, mainly to the config.yml file. Deleted all existing posts and wrote this one.

Since Github supports Jekyll natively, I could just push the whole set of files as is to a newly created repo (idling-mind.github.io) and voila! everything is working fine!
Super excited! Planning to make some changes to the way site is laid out soon.

Here are the things in my mind

1. Edit the theme so that it follows google's [Material Design](http://www.getmdl.io/index.html)
2. Add a commenting option in the page with the help of [Diqus](https://disqus.com/)
3. Add an Archive page with links to all my posts
4. Write some good posts!!
