Got my blog online. It was a struggle! I am pretty new to github pages (i'm pretty new to github as well!). I heard about Jekyll for the first time today. It took some time to figure out what it is. Now that I figured out what Jekyll is, next I wanted to use it to run my blog; and for that every site that I found a tutorial on Jekyll suggested to install a Jekyll on my local machine. I run a windows machine and well, thats not an operating system for the hackers! so well, that didnt go well. After an hour or two, I decided to just download an already working Jekyll site and modify that and thats where I found this template from.
